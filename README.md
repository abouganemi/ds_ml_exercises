# **Data Science & Machine Learning Practice Repository**

## **Overview**

This repository is dedicated to **practicing Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML)** through structured projects. Each project contains a **set of AI-generated questions** that guide the learning process. These questions are designed to **progressively build problem-solving skills**, covering different aspects of DS/ML, from data preprocessing to advanced modeling.

The primary goal is to apply DS/ML techniques to **real-world datasets** while emphasizing **self-directed learning** with AI assistance.

## **Project Structure**

Each project consists of:

- **15 to 20 well-defined questions** generated based on the problem statement and learning objectives.
- **A structured approach to solving problems**, where AI provides hints but does not directly supply the code.
- **A final review phase** for optimizations, best practices, and alternative implementations.

## **AI-Assisted Learning Methodology**

The AI is used as a **learning assistant** rather than a direct solution provider. The interaction follows these structured rules:

### **Rules for AI Assistance**

1. **No direct code answers**
   - AI provides **algorithmic guidance** rather than explicit code solutions.
   - The focus is on **understanding logic, best practices, and theoretical concepts** before implementation.

2. **Hint-based problem solving**
   - AI assists with **breaking down the problem** into logical steps.
   - Hints are given **in the form of pseudo-code, conceptual explanations, or problem-solving approaches**.

3. **Code review after self-implementation**
   - Once a task is completed, AI helps **review the implementation** for:
     - Code efficiency and optimization.
     - Best practices and alternative approaches.
     - Error handling and performance improvements.

4. **AI-assisted debugging and analysis**
   - If a solution does not work, AI helps **troubleshoot issues**.
   - AI provides **validation techniques** to ensure correctness.

5. **Exploration of multiple approaches**
   - AI suggests **alternative methods** (e.g., different models, preprocessing techniques, or evaluation metrics).
   - Encourages comparison of **various DS/ML techniques**.

## **Workflow**

Each project follows a structured workflow:

### **1. Problem Definition**

- Identify the dataset and define **key objectives**.
- List **learning areas** (e.g., feature engineering, model selection, data visualization).

### **2. AI-Generated Questions**

- AI generates **15-20 progressively challenging questions**.
- Covers **basic, intermediate, and advanced** aspects of the dataset.

### **3. Independent Problem-Solving**

- The learner writes **their own code** using **AI hints** (without direct code solutions).
- Encouraged to explore **multiple techniques**.

### **4. Code Review & Optimization**

- AI reviews the code **after the task is completed**.
- Focus on:
  - Efficiency improvements.
  - Alternative implementations.
  - Industry best practices.

### **5. Model Evaluation & Validation**

- AI suggests **metrics for validation**.
- Helps troubleshoot **errors or inconsistencies**.

### **6. Documentation & Reflection**

- Final implementation is **documented**.
- Learner reflects on **challenges, improvements, and insights**.

## **Example: Video Game Sales Analysis**

For example, in the **Video Game Sales Prediction project**, the AI-generated questions guided the learning process through:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding dataset structure.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Generating visual insights.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features based on platform, genre, and sales regions.
   - Encoding categorical variables.

3. **Regression & Classification Models**
   - Predicting global sales using regional sales.
   - Transforming the problem into a **classification task** by defining sales categories.

4. **Data Imbalance Handling**
   - Identifying **overfitting issues**.
   - Using techniques like **SMOTE** and **class weighting**.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Applying **confusion matrices, precision-recall analysis, and alternative classifiers**.

Each stage of the process involved **AI-guided hints** while ensuring full **independent implementation**.

## **Why This Approach?**

This method enforces:
✔ **Active problem-solving** rather than passive learning.
✔ **Deeper understanding** of DS/ML concepts.
✔ **Strong debugging and optimization skills**.
✔ **Ability to implement and evaluate multiple approaches**.
✔ **Professional-level code quality and best practices**.

By following this structured learning model, **AI is leveraged as an assistant rather than a crutch**, fostering **independent analytical skills**.
