    "## **Level 1: Basic Exploration and Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How many unique platforms and genres are present in the dataset?**  \n",
    "   Count the unique values in the `Platform` and `Genre` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the top 5 most common publishers and genres by game count?**  \n",
    "   Use `value_counts()` to get the top 5 publishers and genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the average and median global sales across all platforms.**  \n",
    "   Group the data by platform and calculate the mean and median for `Global_Sales`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which year had the highest number of game releases, and how many games were released that year?**  \n",
    "   Use `groupby()` and `count()` to find the year with the most releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plot a bar chart of total global sales by genre.**  \n",
    "   Group by `Genre` and aggregate global sales, then plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Level 2: Intermediate Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are the top 10 games by global sales?**  \n",
    "   Sort the dataset by Global_Sales and select the top 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is the average sales per year globally across all platforms?**  \n",
    "    Group the data by year and compute the mean global sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Create a scatter plot of NA_Sales vs. EU_Sales. What pattern, if any, can you observe?**  \n",
    "   Use a scatter plot to identify relationships or trends.\n",
    "   \n",
    "9. **Find the platform with the highest total sales globally. Which game contributed the most to these sales?**  \n",
    "   Group by `Platform`, aggregate `Global_Sales`, and identify the top game contributing to the platformâ€™s success.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Compute the correlation between global sales and regional sales (NA, EU, JP, etc.).**  \n",
    "   Use the `corr()` method to analyze correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Level 3: Data Science Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Perform linear regression to predict Global_Sales using NA_Sales and EU_Sales as predictors.**  \n",
    "    Train a regression model using `sklearn` or `statsmodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Perform feature scaling on the sales columns and train a k-means clustering model to group games into clusters based on regional sales.**   \n",
    "    Apply scaling and clustering to see patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Which cluster has the games with the highest sales, and what is the general genre distribution within that cluster?**   \n",
    "    Analyze the clusters and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Compute the rolling average of yearly sales and identify any trends or spikes.**   \n",
    "   Use the `rolling()` method to smooth out time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Use the merge_asof() method to combine the yearly sales data with an external time series dataset (like inflation rates) and analyze any relationships.**   \n",
    "    Integrate and interpret data from two time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Level 4: Advanced Analytics & Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Generate a heatmap showing the correlation between platforms, genres, and regional sales.**   \n",
    "    Visualize the correlations to uncover hidden patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Identify genres with the highest variance in sales across regions using standard deviation.**\n",
    "    Find which genres have the most sales variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Train both a classification model and a regression model to predict global sales.**  \n",
    "    Using `scikit-learn` or `statsmodels` to compare the performance of each and discuss when each model would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **Build a predictive model to classify whether a game will have high or low global sales based on its regional sales.**\n",
    "    Train a classification model using `scikit-learn` or `statsmodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Analyze outliers in the dataset using the IQR (interquartile range) method and visualize the top 10 outliers.**   \n",
    "    Detect and visualize outliers in the dataset.\n",
